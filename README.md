# 🚀 VectorForge ML  
### High-Performance Machine Learning Framework in C++

---

## 📌 Overview

VectorForge ML is a machine learning framework built from scratch in C++, focused on understanding the mathematical foundations of ML while designing a scalable and performance-oriented system.

Unlike traditional ML libraries that abstract away implementation details, this project emphasizes:

- Manual implementation of core algorithms  
- Mathematical clarity  
- Optimization techniques  
- Clean modular architecture  
- Progressive system scaling  

The goal is to evolve this project from a beginner-level implementation into a research-ready ML engine with performance benchmarking and optional R integration.

## 🎯 Project Vision

This project is being built in structured phases:

🌱 **Beginner** → Basic Linear Regression  
🌿 **Intermediate** → Logistic Regression, K-Means  
🌳 **Advanced** → Neural Networks, Optimization, Multithreading  
📊 **Research Level** → Benchmarking + IEEE Paper  

We are building this step-by-step to ensure deep understanding and strong engineering foundations.

## 📊 Performance Philosophy

VectorForge ML is designed with:

- Efficient memory usage  
- Manual vector operations  
- Gradient optimization techniques  
- Future support for multithreading  
- Benchmark comparison with native R implementations  

Performance metrics will be published in later versions.

## 📘 Educational Purpose

This project is designed to:

- Strengthen understanding of ML mathematics  
- Improve C++ engineering skills  
- Build systems-level optimization knowledge  
- Prepare for ML/Backend/Research roles  

It is not meant to replace production ML libraries — it is meant to deeply understand and build one.
